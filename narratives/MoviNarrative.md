abstract: "*Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae* (Movi) causes respiratory disease in wild and domestic sheep and goats around the world, resulting in economic losses for the domestic sheep industry and severe population declines for wild species. We performed phylogenetic analyses using 99 Movi genomes from four host species across six countries. Scroll down to learn more."

# [Genetic divergence across host species](https://nextstrain.org/community/kimandrews/Movi/phylogeny?d=tree&c=hostspecies&legend=open)
We found that Movi has two major genetic groups or "clades" that are separated by host species (domestic sheep versus domestic goat). These two clades are divergent enough to be considered separate species, indicating that the clades likely evolved in separate ancestral host species. We refer to these as the "sheep clade" and the "goat clade."

# [Transmission to bighorn sheep](https://nextstrain.org/community/kimandrews/Movi/phylogeny?d=tree&c=hostspecies&legend=open)
Almost all bighorn sheep strains fall within the sheep clade and do not cluster separately from domestic sheep strains in the tree, indicating that Movi has been transmitted from domestic sheep to bighorn sheep many times. One bighorn sheep herd from New Mexico has strains from the goat clade, indicating that transmission of Movi sometimes also occurs from domestic goats to bighorn sheep.

# [Caribou strains](https://nextstrain.org/community/kimandrews/Movi/phylogeny?d=tree&c=hostspecies&legend=open)
The Alaska caribou strains occur within the sheep clade and cluster more closely with strains from France and China than from the USA, but nonetheless are highly divergent from those strains, indicating that our dataset does not include any close relatives to the caribou strains. These results suggest that the caribou strains may be descendants of a separate introduction to the USA than the introductions from which all other USA strains in our dataset are descended. However, our analyses cannot identify the geographic source, date, or number of Movi introductions into Alaska wildife populations; to address these questions, more samples would be needed from more caribou populations and all potential introduction source regions.

# [Genetic diversity: Domestic host species](https://nextstrain.org/community/kimandrews/Movi/phylogeny?d=tree&c=domestic_pop&legend=closed)
Within both the sheep and goat clades, Movi has high genetic diversity and minimal genetic clustering by geography. In fact, highly divergent strains can even be found in the same herd. For example, each of the three domestic sheep farms sampled in Idaho had some strains that are very far apart on the tree. These patterns likely result from large population sizes and relatively frequent long-distance movements of domestic sheep and goats by humans.

# [Genetic diversity: Bighorn sheep hosts](https://nextstrain.org/community/kimandrews/Movi/phylogeny?d=tree&c=wild_pop&legend=closed)
For bighorn sheep host species, Movi shows similar patterns of diversity as for domestic species, with high genetic diversity and minimal genetic clustering by geography. However, within herds, all bighorn sheep usually have a nearly identical strain. These patterns provide further evidence for frequent transmission of Movi from domestic sheep to bighorn sheep herds, and minimal transmission between bighorn sheep herds.
